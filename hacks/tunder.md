# TUNDER

I've heard from a friend that on Tinder you swipe left or right to like/dislike someone. How horrible is that?

Imagine the same but for items. You swipe right and we will use gravity to show you more items like that. You swipe left... well ... we need to figure out what to do in that case.

## Who's Participating?

- You?
