# A I S T H E T I C S

Since Team Data is starting to work on an 'interesting items' list for the tutti frontpage, we 
need to decide if an item is interesting. But besides this lies the fact that an ugly picture
is less appealing for a user even if the item on sale is very interesting.

This could serve as a filter to discard (very) ugly pictures from the interesting items list.
It could have a number of other applications such as making social media managing easier by
automagically providing listings with nice pictures, or even warning a user if the pictures for 
their ad are very yucky.

## Disclaimer

I have not given much thought to this and don't even know if it is a viable project for 2 days.
However I see it as a chance for me to get into CNNs and image based machine learning in general.
